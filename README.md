# codepublishing-twitterbot
A twitter bot that tweets a section of the municipal code of a city

**This project is under construction, but once a twitter bot has been deployed, this readme will be updated.**

## Why?

This bot is inspired by other twitter bots such as [Every Lot Bot](https://twitter.com/everylotsf) and [Every Census Tract](https://twitter.com/everytract) which chronicle the built environment through pictures of lots and aerial images showing the spatial layout of the land.  This bot seeks to add to this story by chronicling the zoning laws of a particular city that shape what gets built.  

Furthermore, this github project seeks to provide a means to download codes and/or create other twitter bots that could tweet any subsection of a municipal code published at http://www.codepublishing.com/.
